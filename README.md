# SublimeTabsShortcuts

Adds the following keyboard shortcuts to Sublime Text:

* Close other tabs: `Cmd+Shift+W` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+W` on Windows and Linux
* Close tabs to the right: `Cmd+Alt+W` on Mac, `Ctrl+Alt+W` on Windows and Linux

They're also made available in the Command Palette.

Of course, the shortcuts are overridable (`Preferences > Packages Settings > Key Bindings - User` or `TabShortcuts: Key Bindings` in the command palette).

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

Coming soon...

### Without Package Control ###

Clone (or download and unzip) this into your `Packages` directory (`Browse Packages` in Sublime's Command Palette).

## Support

So far this has only been tested on Sublime 3 for Mac, but it should also work for Sublime 2, and on Linux and Windows as well.
