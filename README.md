# SublimeTabsShortcuts

Adds the tabs controls already available on right-click in the `Command Palette` and assigns them keyboard shortcuts:

* Close Other Tabs: `Cmd+Shift+W` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+W` on Windows and Linux
* Close Tabs to the Right: `Cmd+Alt+W` on Mac, `Ctrl+Alt+W` on Windows and Linux

Of course, the shortcuts are overridable (`Preferences > Packages Settings > TabsShortcuts > Key Bindings - User` or `TabsShortcuts: Key Bindings` in the Command Palette).

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

Coming soon...

### Without Package Control ###

Clone (or download and unzip) this into your `Packages` directory (`Browse Packages` in Sublime's Command Palette).

## Support

So far this has only been tested on Sublime 3 for Mac, but it should also work for Sublime 2, and on Linux and Windows as well.
